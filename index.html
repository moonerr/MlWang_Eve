                            Stress can cause harm to peopleâ€™s mental and physical health and reduce the overall happiness of society <sup class="cite">(1)</sup>.
                            <br>
                            We focus on young adults who feel stressed out in their lives and want to escape for a moment.

                            <span style="color: rgb(255, 168, 134);">? Why is 'stress' the focus</span>
                            <br>
                            From my desk research, it looks clear that stress is generated during people's coping with their environment<sup class="intextcite">(2)</sup>.
                            And from personal observations also, being stressed is often treated as a failure of emotional management. 
                            Sometimes it requires too much for individuals to grow to meet the requirements for the development of society. 
                            Many works have done by digital technologies to improve efficiency, cooperativeness and fantasy. 
                            We definitely could make some changes to the environment just for people to relieve themselves.

                            <br>As a semester project, we are supposed to build one prototype to demonstrate our concepts. Even though we found being stressful can occur to anyone,
                            we still need to focus on a specific group to tailor the requirements and constraints to practical design work.
                            We choose young adults, not only for they are facing much stress and also for it is more accessible for us to observe their
                            pressure and talk with them about their emotions. And also, we will be more capable of understanding and sharing feelings with this group.

                    <h3><span style="font-style:normal">&#127773;</span> Intended Concept</h3>

                    <p>
                        My solution for future Mundane to this problem is to build a private space for the public. 
                        It should be accessible for everybody as destressing would become a natural needs for everyone in a crazy assumption of the future.  
                        <br>
                        When someone is entering, this space begins to work. Users can set the brightness of the whole to suit them best. 
                        The entire area has a cylindrical shape with a soft floor and round wall. 
                        <br>    
                        
                        They could stand, sit or lie down; with either posture, they could find their way to throw, squeeze, slap the ball-shaped bodies(planets) 
                        to generate multiple changes to this space.  These changes include vibration, colours, surrounding sound.
                        
                        And with the interactive process, everyone could get their stress released by multi-sensory therapy.
