                    Stress can cause harm to people’s mental and physical health and reduce the overall happiness of society <sup class="cite">(1)</sup>.
                    <br>
                    We focus on young adults who feel stressed out in their lives and want to escape for a moment.

                <p>
                    <span>? Why is 'stress' the focus</span>
                    <br>
                    From my desk research, it looks clear that stress is generated during people's coping with their environment<sup class="intextcite">(2)</sup>.
                    And from personal observations also, being stressed is often treated as a failure of emotional management. 
                    Sometimes it requires too much for individuals to grow to meet the requirements for the development of society. 
                    Many works have done by digital technologies to improve efficiency, cooperativeness and fantasy. 
                    We definitely could make some changes to the environment just for people to relieve themselves.

                <p>
                    <span>? Why young adults </span>
                    <br>As a semester project, we are supposed to build one prototype to demonstrate our concepts. Even though we found being stressful can occur to anyone,
                    we still need to focus on a specific group to tailor the requirements and constraints to practical design work.
                    We choose young adults, not only for they are facing much stress and also for it is more accessible for us to observe their
                    pressure and talk with them about their emotions. And also, we will be more capable of understanding and sharing feelings with this group.

            <p>
                My solution for future Mundane to this problem is to build a private space for the public. 
                It should be accessible for everybody as destressing would become a natural needs for everyone in a crazy assumption of the future.  
                <br>
                When someone is entering, this space begins to work. Users can set the brightness of the whole to suit them best. 
                The entire area has a cylindrical shape with a soft floor and round wall. 
                <br>    
                They could stand, sit or lie down; with either posture, they could find their way to throw, squeeze, slap the ball-shaped bodies(planets) 
                to generate multiple changes to this space.  These changes include vibration, colours, surrounding sound.
                <br>
                It is a room without intructions and what needs to be done. Just a set of various interactions for people to explore.
                <br>
                And with the interactive process, everyone could get their stress released by multi-sensory therapy.

                Move your cursor within the space and hear the sound moving 
                between ears(headphone recommended).
                The numbers shows where the sound is moving. 
                Ideally in the physical space, there should be a set of speakers that surround the space and the sound moves arround the user.

                Various balls have been made to fit the theme of "galaxies". With lavender smell, the space changes the colours, vibrations, surround music by users' interaction with the balls, like squeezing, hugging ang tapping.

                        The virable <code>Adjust</code> is created to calculate the difference 
                        between the values of pressure for each side.
                        Thus, the first step is to use one value to minus the other.
                        <br>
                        Then because the default frame rate of Processing is 60, which is to say,
                        it will read about every 20ms. So secondly, it is essential to
                        set a timmer for the arduino to send the value every 50ms, which should be 
                        no less than 20ms.
                        <br>
                        It is also important to check the writing capability of Arduino Uno.
                        While using <code>Serial.write()</code>, the data is sent by <em>One byte</em> 
                        each time. So it is why in here Adjust was mapped to 0 ~ 2<sup>8</sup>-1.

                        There are much more balls connected, so the port in use are more than two.
                        <code>myportN</code> is used to contain the port from the port list.
                        <code>posN</code> is used to store the value sent by Arduino.
                        It is surprising to find that when we use USB hubs, the port name will expand by two numbers.
                        So it will be better to use port list to get their names.

                        <code>port.available()</code> is used to check whether the port is receiving data from Arduino.
                        When it is working, then it is the time to read and store it into <code>posN</code>.
                        When it gets the data, the music file can be played if it is not turned on. 
                        This piece is to avoid lag music.

                    When the user squeezes FSR, the VMs begin to work.
                    <br> 
                    The frequency of each VM is changing with the force applied.

                    Simultaneously, processing copes with the force values and
                    reveals the changes by moving the sound between two channels.
                    Then console prints the value of <code>balance</code> every frame.

                    <br>
                    The foam of the playmat is an attractive choice to wrap the sensor,
                    for it is solid but relatively resilient.
                    It will fix and protect the sensor and give a bigger contact surface for each ball.

                <video src="videos/foam.mp4" controls></video>
                <p>
                    The video shows how soft foam works in resilience but lacks solid support.
                    It would be easy to damage the sensor if users squeeze the sensor at an inappropriate angle.

                And then adhere them all to make it a core for the ball.

                    One time I tried to wrap them with balloons, but it affected the value of FSR,
                    and then I adjust the mapping of it. But it still did not work well on the spot.
                    If only I could get a larger one, I think it would be working in some way.</p>

                    <p>
                    Coming to the use of cloth, it is very similar to using a sponge.
                    But because it is the outermost layer, very delicate handwork is required.

                    <p>
                    
                    <br>
                    First, cut out two circles from paper.
                    The diameter of the circle is 3/2 that of the target ball.
                    And then cut out the overlayed part of the circle and make it a bare board.
                    <br>
                    Then outlines the shapes of the board on the cloth and cut them out of 4 pieces.
                    <br>
                    The fabric is very elastic, verified by my teammates that sewing machines would not help.
                    <br>
                    So I, a craftsman,  sew two and a half cloth covers.
                    To make it look best,  I sewed the four pieces of cloth into a spherical
                    shape by the hidden needle stitching method.
                    <br>
                    After finishing wrapping, they are sent to be coloured.
                    I coloured one ball with acrylic paint. It needs to be diluted to a particular
                    concentration not to affect the light transmittance.

                            Positive emotions can help adapt stress level by sustaining coping efforts, providing a “breather,”
                            and restoring depleted resources.(Folkman & Moskowitz, 2000; LAZARUS et al., 1980)

                            Positive emotions can be generated in three ways: Positive Reappraisal, Problem-Focused Coping methods,
                            and Creation of Positive Events. (Folkman & Moskowitz, 2000)

                        People tend to avoid complaining which would stacks the unhappy things in mind.
                        Many People tend to cope with negative feelings by themselves, which <b style="color: rgb(255, 112, 87);">justifies creating a private space</b>.                </li>
                    <li>
                        People wanted to look their best and hide the nagative side of emotions which increases peer stress.

                        Time is a resource that is often deficient for people who are working. 
                        They have to spend more time on tough stuff if there is a stuck, which causes them to overlook their stress.

                <p><b>Key insights & Reflection</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>   <b>'Galaxy' </b>is an imaginative theme that often makes people think of hugeness and distance.
                        We received much feedback that we should increase the number of planets. 
                        So in the final exhibition, we made seven balls hanging in the space. 
                        But it turns out that many things should be placed in an ample space as well. 
                        It turns out that when we think of the galaxies, we recall not only the numerous stars but also the spaciousness it has.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The swings interaction confuses people that they should not like to hold the ball carefully to 
                        experience the surround sound. It is a vigilant interaction, not recommended for people's vent. 
                        It is also caused by technical issues partially. If the ball is hanging with a rope, it will swing quite fast. 
                        Unless we formed some structures that allow slow swing, then it will not be that desirable. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        From the feedback, I came to believe everyone has their framing of stress. Someone might feel difficult to sleep 
                        because of pressure. Someone might want to chill at home to release the tension. 
                        Among all those, we came to the reason why there should be one at public places. 
                        Working people, often young, usually spend 8 to 10 hours a day at the workplace, which occupies 1/3 of the whole day, 
                        even more than their sleeping time. 
                        If sleeping should be paid attention to, it seems reasonable to consider improving the experience during workdays.
                    </li>

                            In this part, we need more information about user senarios to frame our concept. More work is needed here.

                             - Maybe too many colors in the space that looks very busy, but it is hard to balance the dazzeling and the boring.

                             Unsuccessful Parts:
                             - As the old saying goes, the time you spent on your project is twice that of you estimated.
                             It is true true. We kepted behind schedules. Even applies the method of 'working from end', 
                             time estimation is still tought. It also reveals little risk management during this project.
                              
                             My solution to this issue is to seprate individual tasks and team tasks. 
                             Reducing waiting time of other teammates would release each member to finish more work. 
                             So, reducing one-to-one talk in a team meeting is a way.
